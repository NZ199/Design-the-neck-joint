# Design-the-neck-joint
Designing the Neck Joint for the first and second axis using Tinkercad.
- This assignment is part of the Mechanical Engineering track and requires neck joint design for first and second axis using Tinkercad.
- The neck joint is an important component of the robot's head, as it allows movement and rotation in different directions.
### Prerequisites
To complete this task, you will need access to Tinkercad, a cloud-based 3D modeling software. You will also need a basic understanding of mechanical engineering principles, including joints and mechanisms.
